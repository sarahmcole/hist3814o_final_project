On contrasting the prevailing organisms of sewage with those of sewer gas air they were found to bear no resemblance whatever to one another. Conducting the investigations with special reference to typhoid fever it was found that the bacillus of this disease was not only capable of any growth or multiplication in sewage but that each auc-ceedmg day found the number of germs rapidly decrease their ultimate death being a question of only a few days nr at most one or two weeks. Stwsgu is without doubt the most fruitful source of the dissemination of typhoid fever through the pollution of drinking wafer but from the results of these investigations it appear# in the higf est degree unlikely that the air of sewers should play any part in the conveyance of the germs of the disease.

Up to the Crimean war Europe had enjoyed forty years of peace and had begun to think that peace was going to be perpetual. During the subsequent forty years the Comment has been the scene of no less than five great ware while lor tour of these years thecountiy to the south of us was given over to one of the most terrible conflicts in history. But there has been of late a growing distaste for beginning a serious international quarrel. The nations of Europe go on building ships and making gun* but if a strained situation arises the efforts ot diplomatists are at once exerted to smooth matters over in the shortest possible time. There is one view of European snd American armaments which is calculated perhaps to qualify the regret that sometimes be felt at the immense amount of vitality devoted to military and naval preparations and that is that some day in the futute all the western nations will have to stand shoulder to shoulder against the countless millions of the East.

To the rest of the hatter add 1 tablespoonful New Orleans molasses and 1-2 teaspoonful soda dissolved in a little water. As some like these cakes thinner than do others water may be stirred in with the soda and molasses remembering that a little wetting thins a good deal and that the quality of the cakes is injured if flour has to be added at this stage. All the batter should be used ; it is the left-overs that ferment too much and commonly cause the indigestibility of these cakes. The measures given are enough for a family of four or five and one can soon learn to gauge the quantity to the family so that there will be no waste.

When filling the griddle dip.the hatter from the side of the vessel farthest from the griddle otherwise there will be a trail of the batter over the side of the vessel onto the stove and griddle. A greaser should be used instead of putting the fat on the griddle in bits with a knife. This may be a piece of !>ac-on or salt pork on a fork or a swab of muslin tidd to a small stick or fork. Handy greasers may be had tfery cheaply at the house furnishing shops. Only enough grease should be used to make the cakes turn nicely. The griddle should be wiped free from spatters of batter and grease after each baking. This may lie done neatly with a piece of nianilla not newspaper which should be burned when the cakes for the meal are all baked. If these directions are followed the disagreeable and unhealthful smoko and flavor from burned grease may lie avoided. These cakes may be continued from day to indefinitely without the addition of new' yeast provided the fourth of a pint of bat ter is kept in good condition for each day's mixing.
