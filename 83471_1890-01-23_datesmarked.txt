We halted at night until the moon rcee and then marched southward all night, long, swelling plains, with here nod there a higher hill and many clump# of poplar, growing especially in ravines. At daybreak we were near the Indian oamp. Our guns opened with ehrap nel as soon as the enemy was felt. Their fiie was brisk, and our men suffered a good deal, theli z. si causing them to expose themselves too freely. I was near Short, wno, with Ruther'ord, was directing the fire of the guns. Short, as our leader (Colonel Otter) afterward said, seemed te have a charmed life, as he coolly stood in the front lints working hi# guns. The action w*t very sharp, and It was difficult to see the enemy's sharpshooters, hidden as they were In the brushwood.
While I was watching a severe contest on my left I heard some ooe shout ‘'Lick out there—look at these fellows I" and I saw a party of many Indians io the bush close to us. They came quickly, making a rush for the Gatling. In an instant Short, with hli revolver an-! sword drawn, had called us to him, and following him we rushed at the eiemy. 1 remember seeing Short'# light forage cap lilted on his head by a shot that passed through It, and then I saw him han-i to hand with the Indians, shooting one and running for another, who fired at him, but missed. Toe Indian fab, a war whoop on hli lips. We fir.»d and fired, and the enemy ran. 1 stopped for a moment at the body of the Indian who had fired last at Short.

In the excitement I should like to have looted all hi# sav&go frippery, but we had to rush back to the Gatling. Then occurred more fighting, and it was not until acme time later that w e found ws had done what we could in breaking the enemy's march westward anti in giving them a leeeon, and that oui smal. force was not able to do more.
